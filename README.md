# theherk commons

These are the configuration details and files I use to configure my environment. Feel free to peruse if it suits you.

_update 2021-06-29_: The koolaid is delicious. I have removed most things that were unique to Arch, Manjaro, and Windows. Not that I'll never use them, but probably not often. Nevertheless, if you seek files that were used in that linux context, like X configuration, termite, rofi, i3, etc. check out one of the blockpoints up to b3.

## Credits

More are warranted, but the two I can think to mention off the bat are:

- [matlocktheartist](https://www.deviantart.com/matlocktheartist/art/Bruce-Lee-Puzzled-322967405) for providing the awesome Bruce Lee art.

## Enjoy
